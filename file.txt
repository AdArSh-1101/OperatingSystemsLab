I don’t like it. These thoughts that fill his head, his past that only bothers him so much, and-

“Oh, Gin!”

After Jin came down from the gym, Altina and Claire vigorously waved at him.

Even Jin nodding his head as if in response to the greetings of the two, everything.

“…..”

Seeing that, Erekaya’s heart, which had been excited for a while due to Jin’s victory, cooled down again.

For some reason, I didn’t feel good. It was unpleasant. Annoyed.

I can’t greet him like they do. can’t shake hands can’t make you laugh

because he is guilty Because he is no different from his enemy. Because he was the one who created the environment that forced him to act that way.

That’s why her heart breaks even more.
